1.What is Continuous Integration?
	
2.What is Continuous Deployment?
	
3.Can you describe an example of a CI (and/or CD) process starting the moment a developer submitted a change/PR to a repository?
	
4.What is Continuous Delivery?
	
5.What is difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
	
6.What CI/CD best practices are you familiar with? Or what do you consider as CI/CD best practice?
	
7.You are given a pipeline and a pool with 3 workers: virtual machine, baremetal and a container. How will you decide on which one of them to run the pipeline?
	
8.Where do you store CI/CD pipelines? Why?
	
9.How do you perform plan capacity for your CI/CD resources? (e.g. servers, storage, etc.)
	
10.How would you structure/implement CD for an application which depends on several other applications?
	
11.How do you measure your CI/CD quality? Are there any metrics or KPIs you are using for measuring the quality?
	
12.What is Jenkins? What have you used it for?
	
-------------------------------------------------Answers---------------------------------
1.Continuous integration refers to the build and unit testing stages of the software release process. Every revision that is committed triggers an automated build and test. With continuous delivery, code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production.
2.Continuous deployment is a strategy in software development where code changes to an application are released automatically into the production environment. This automation is driven by a series of predefined tests. Once new updates pass those tests, the system pushes the updates directly to the software's users.
3.There are many answers for such a question, as CI processes vary, depending on the technologies used and the type of the project to where the change was submitted. Such processes can include one or more of the following stages:

Compile
Build
Install
Configure
Update
Test
An example of one possible answer:

A developer submitted a pull request to a project. The PR (pull request) triggered two jobs (or one combined job). One job for running lint test on the change and the second job for building a package which includes the submitted change, and running multiple api/scenario tests using that package. Once all tests passed and the change was approved by a maintainer/core, it’s merged/pushed to the repository. If some of the tests failed, the change will not be allowed to merged/pushed to the repository.

A complete different answer or CI process, can describe how a developer pushes code to a repository, a workflow then triggered to build a container image and push it to the registry. Once in the registry, the k8s cluster is applied with the new changes.
4.A development strategy used to frequently deliver code to QA and Ops for testing. This entails having a staging area that has production like features where changes can only be accepted for production after a manual review. Because of this human entanglement there is usually a time lag between release and review making it slower and error prone as compared to continous deployment.
5.Continuous Delivery is a software engineering practice where the code changes are prepared to be released. Continuous Deployment aims at continuously releasing the code changes into the production environment.
6. Automated process of building, testing and deploying software
   Commit and test often
   Testing/Staging environment should be a clone of production environment
7. Containers are more lightweight than VMs, as their images are measured in megabytes rather than gigabytes. Containers require fewer IT resources to deploy, run, and manage. Containers spin up in milliseconds. Since their order of magnitude is smaller.
8. There are multiple approaches as to where to store the CI/CD pipeline definitions:

   App Repository – store them in the same repository of the application they are building or testing (perhaps the most popular one)
   Central Repository – store all organization’s/project’s CI/CD pipelines in one separate repository (perhaps the best approach when multiple teams test the same set of projects and they end up having many pipelines)
   CI repo for every app repo – you separate CI related code from app code but you don’t put everything in one place (perhaps the worst option due to the maintenance)
9.The CI/CD pipeline combines continuous integration, delivery and deployment into four major phases: source, build, test and deploy. Each phase uses highly detailed processes, standards, tools and automation.
10. Code: Checked into the repository.
    Build: Build is triggered and deployed in a test environment.
    Test: Automated tests are executed.
    Deploy: Code is deployed to stage, and production environments.
11.DevOps organizations can measure and optimize the performance of their CI/CD pipeline by using the following key metrics:
   Test pass rate. The ratio between passed test cases with the total number of test cases.
             Number of bugs. 
             Defect escape rate. 
             Number of code branches.
   DevOps organizations monitor their CI/CD pipeline across three groups of metrics:
             Automation performance
	     Speed
	     Quality
12.Jenkins is an open-source free automation tool used to build and test software projects. The tool makes it painless for developers to integrate changes to the project. Jenkins' primary focus is to keep track of the version control system and initiate and monitor a build system if there are any changes.
   It is used to continually create and test software projects, making it easier for developers and DevOps engineers to integrate changes to the project and for consumers to get a new build.

Violations:
1. Wildcard imports (from requests import *) are generally discouraged and should be avoided.
2. The function get_error_message() is missing a return statement at the end, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
3. The indentation of the else: clause in the get_error_message() function is incorrect.
4. The main() function is missing an indentation level, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

6. Admin Author List: templates/admin/author_list.html 
7. Admin Author Create: templates/admin/author_create.html 
8. Admin Author Update: templates/admin/author_update.html 
9. Admin Author Delete: templates/admin/author_delete.html

IV. Static Folder 
Add the below files to the static folder
1. CSS File: static/css/main.css 
2. Bootstrap File: static/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css 
3. JS File: static/js/main.js

V. Use Bootstrap Modules 
1. Use the Bootstrap Grid System, Forms, Buttons, and Navbars.
2. Use the Bootstrap components like Alerts, Modals, and Dropdowns.

VI. Change Admin Interface 
1. Add an Admin Panel page to manage Authors.
2. Create a separate page to add, update and delete Authors.
3. Add additional functionality such as sorting, filtering and pagination.



2) Create a ModelForm for AUTHOR{name, book and bookid}
Add the table <appname>_author into the database.

class AuthorForm(ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Author
        fields = ['name', 'book', 'bookid']




3) Render HTML Forms (GET & POST) in Django for the fields fist name and last name

&lt;form action="" method="post"&gt;
    {% csrf_token %}
    &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label for="firstName"&gt;First Name:&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" class="form-control" name="firstName" id="firstName"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label for="lastName"&gt;Last Name:&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" class="form-control" name="lastName" id="lastName"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;



4) Use Django built-in methods to validate form login page data automatically. Use CSRF tokens.

&lt;form action="" method="post"&gt;
    {% csrf_token %}
    &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label for="firstName"&gt;First Name:&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" class="form-control" name="firstName" id="firstName"&gt;
        {% if form.errors.firstName %}
            &lt;div class="alert alert-danger"&gt;
                {{ form.errors.firstName }}
            &lt;/div&gt;
        {% endif %}
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label for="lastName"&gt;Last Name:&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" class="form-control" name="lastName" id="lastName"&gt;
        {% if form.errors.lastName %}
            &lt;div class="alert alert-danger"&gt;
                {{ form.errors.lastName }}
            &lt;/div&gt;
        {% endif %}
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;



			Model form

1) Create a model form and write the CRUD queries in the dijango shell
class sampleModel(models.Model):
