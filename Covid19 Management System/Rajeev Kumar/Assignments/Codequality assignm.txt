1)
In terms of code quality, version three is the best of the three as it uses a more efficient loop structure and has better formatting for the print statement. Additionally, it avoids unnecessary variables and functions.

2)

Version four:
numbers = []
    def add_number(num): 
    numbers.append(num)
 while True:
 answer = input(&#27;Enter a number: &#27;)
 if answer != &#27;quit&#27;:
    add_number(answer)
 else:
    break
 print(&#27;Numbers: %s&#27; % numbers)

3)The better code is version two because it is simpler and uses modern features such as f-strings and operator. It is also more concise and easier to read than version one and three.

4)
Violations:
1. Wildcard imports (from requests import *) are generally discouraged and should be avoided.
2. The function get_error_message() is missing a return statement at the end, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
3. The indentation of the else: clause in the get_error_message() function is incorrect.
4. The main() function is missing an indentation level, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
